Source citing for Pymaceuticals

I found a new way to combine .unique with the number of values in a variable while using .nunique by finding this reference in a google search:
https://github.com/redeat17/Matplotlib-Challenge/blob/master/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb This is a GitHub on Pymaceuticals posted by redeat17. I then looked up the difference between unique and nunique here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_nunique.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,unique%20values%20for%20each%20row. This meant I also had to add an import for numpy.

Garret, gfrank on Slack, the Learning Assistant, helped me add the .duplicated function to my code to find the duplicate mice by ID Number. I had most of the original code using .loc and .unique, but I kept getting an error and wasn't finding the repeats. 
duplicate_mice = pymaceutical_main.loc[pymaceutical_main.duplicated(subset=['Mouse ID', 'Timepoint']),'Mouse ID'].unique()

Bigyan, bkhanal on Slack, the Learning Assistant, helped me discover I needed to add the function .index to my .values line when trying to get the right data to plot in my pyplot bar graph. She helped me create "drug_regimen_counts.index.values" to find my x-axis values.

Jesse Wright, the tutor for my session, helped me process through my quartiles, outliers and box plot. Specifically, he helped me re-direct my for loop to get the correct data in my max tumor volume list. He basically helped me develop this: tumor_volume = mice_by_tumor.loc[mice_by_tumor["Drug Regimen"] == drug, "Tumor Volume (mm3)"]

I used this Stacked Overflow thread to format my outlier in the box plot by Drug Regimen, https://stackoverflow.com/a/65648952/21682939. I used this code: 
flierprops={'marker': 'o', 'markersize': 10, 'markerfacecolor': 'fuchsia'} written by JohanC and adjusted the color to red.
